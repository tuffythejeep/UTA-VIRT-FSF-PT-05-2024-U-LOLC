      <p>My given name is Jorge Alejandro Garcia. My mom and wife call me Alex - so you can too!
        I've been married 25 years this year, and my wife and I have 2 grown kids. Our daughter 
        will start Med School this year, and our son is a software engineer who works at USAA with me.
        I have an undergrad in Public Relations from UTSA, and an MBA from University of Incarnate Word 
        (UIW in San Antonio). I work as a SAFe Release Train Engineer (RTE) and Program Manager Lead on
        the Property Insurance Company's Innnovation Team. 
        Fun Fact: Before USAA I was a cab driver in San Antonio for almost eight years.
        I've always wanted to learn how to code, so I decided to enroll in UT-Austin's Coding Bootcamp.
